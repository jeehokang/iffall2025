        <h1>Jeeho Kang Introductory Questions</h1>

        <p>1. Jeeho Kang, Communication Design and Marketing double major, junior</p>

        <p>2. I have always been interested in graphic/digital design so I entered Sam Fox. I wanted to take this class
            not only because it is a requirement but also I wanted to grasp better understanding in utilizing html and VS code.</p>
        
        <p>3. I don't have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</p>

        <p>4. I want to understand the basis of HTML/CSS and be more comfortable with the tools.</p>

        <p>5. I feel like with screens you would want to also focus on dynamic elements. Unlike paper which is a still element,
            screens allow viewers to move around which leaves a room for dynamic elements such as scrolls and animations. 
        </p>

        <p>6. https://andwalsh.com/ I think Jessica Walsh's website is a good example of an effective design because
            it has some interactive features that allow the viewers to engage with her works more effectively. For example,
            the curser that is circle, a circle rotating on the right bottom of the website as you scroll the page all 
            contributes to an effective website design.
        </p>

        <p>7. https://www.nytimes.com/ I believe the New York Times is a strong example of effective communication because as a newspaper, it not only
            delievers accurate information but presents them in a way that they are clear and accessible through consistent
            fonts, different tabs, and images.
        </p>

        <p>8. https://open.spotify.com/ I think the Spotify website works well through its distintive design and easy navigation. I can easily see what's
            trending, my library and access friends' accounts.
